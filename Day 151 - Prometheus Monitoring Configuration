Q1. Prometheus Class -2 Assignment-1

Assignment 1: Configuration and Verification of Prometheus for a Sample HTTP Server
Objective:
Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from an existing Python HTTP server (server.py) and ensure that the metrics are correctly displayed in the Prometheus UI.

Prerequisites:
Python and Prometheus are already installed and running.
Create a server.py:
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Counter, Histogram
import random
import time

# Metrics to track.
REQUESTS = Counter('total_requests', 'Total web requests made')
ERRORS = Counter('error_count', 'Total web requests errors')
LATENCY = Histogram('request_duration_seconds', 'Histogram for the duration in seconds.', buckets=(1, 2, 5, 6, 10))

def process_request(t):
    """Simulates a request processing that takes 't' seconds."""
    time.sleep(t)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Start up the server to expose the metrics.
    start_http_server(8000)
    # Simulate some requests.
    while True:
        process_request(random.choice([1, 2, 5, 6, 10]))
        REQUESTS.inc()
        if random.choice([0, 1]) == 1:
            ERRORS.inc()
        LATENCY.observe(random.choice([1, 2, 5, 6, 10]))
Install pip and Activate the python environment then run python3 server.py &

Tasks:
Task 1: Configure Prometheus to Scrape the Python HTTP Server
Modify the Prometheus configuration to include the Python HTTP server as a target, ensuring Prometheus can collect metrics exposed by the server.

Steps:
Edit Prometheus Configuration:
Locate and open the /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml configuration file in your Prometheus setup.

Add a new scrape job configuration to scrape metrics from the Python HTTP server:

Job name is 'python_http_server'
scrape interval is 15 seconds
Target is localhost and port is 8000.
This configuration sets Prometheus to scrape metrics from localhost:8000 every 15 seconds.

Restart Prometheus:
Restart Prometheus to apply the new configuration. This can typically be done by restarting the Prometheus service or container.
Use the following command if Prometheus is running as a service: sudo systemctl restart prometheus
Task 2: Verify Metrics in Prometheus
Ensure that Prometheus is successfully scraping metrics from the Python HTTP server and display these metrics in the Prometheus UI.

Steps:
Verify Scrape Target Status:
Open the Prometheus web interface.
Navigate to "Status" > "Targets" to check the scrape status of the python_http_server. Ensure the status is "UP".
Query and Visualize Metrics:
Go to the "Graph" tab within the Prometheus UI.
Enter queries to display metrics such as request_duration_seconds_sum
Observe the graphs or tables produced by these queries to confirm that metrics are being collected and displayed correctly.

Ans:

# apt install python3.12-venv
# python3 -m venv venv
# source venv/bin/activate
# pip install -m prometheus_client
# python3 server.py &
# vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  # Existing jobs...

  - job_name: 'python_http_server'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']

# systemctl restart prometheus


Q2. Prometheus Class -2 Assignment-2

Advanced Prometheus Configuration and Dynamic Scraping

Objective:
Configure Prometheus to dynamically scrape targets and manage labels effectively using relabeling rules.

Setup Requirements:

Services Configuration:

Run Node Exporter on Two Different Ports:
Service A: Run Node Exporter on port 9100 (e.g., http://localhost:9100).
Service B: Run Node Exporter on port 9200 (e.g., http://localhost:9200).
These two services will expose metrics at their respective ports for Prometheus to scrape.
Label Management via Relabeling:

Add a label service_type to distinguish between the two services:
service_a for Service A running on port 9100.
service_b for Service B running on port 9200.
Dynamic Target Discovery:

Use file-based service discovery in Prometheus to dynamically discover and scrape targets.

Create a targets.json file that specifies the target services for Prometheus to scrape. This file will be placed in the /etc/prometheus directory.

Verification:

Ensure that the label service_type is correctly applied to both services (service_a for port 9100 and service_b for port 9200).

Use the Prometheus UI to confirm that the services are properly discovered and the labels are visible in the targets section.


Ans:

$ wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.9.1/node_exporter-1.9.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf node_exporter-1.9.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ rm -rf node_exporter-1.9.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
$ nohup ./node_exporter --web.listen-address=":9200" > /dev/null
$ nohup ./node_exporter --web.listen-address=":9200" > /dev/null &

$ vi /etc/prometheus/targets.json
[
  {
    "targets": ["localhost:9100"],
    "labels": {
      "service_type": "service_a"
    }
  },
  {
    "targets": ["localhost:9200"],
    "labels": {
      "service_type": "service_b"
    }
  }
]

$ vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml 
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node_exporters'
    file_sd_configs:
      - files:
          - /etc/prometheus/targets.json

    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_filename]
        action: keep
        regex: .*

      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: instance

      - source_labels: [service_type]
        target_label: service_type

$ systemctl restart prometheus
$ systemctl status prometheus




Q3. Prometheus Class -2 Assignment-3

Assignment 3: Securing Prometheus and Validating Metrics
Objective
Implement security for Prometheus and validate that metrics are correctly labeled.

Tasks
Secure Prometheus Using HTTP Basic Authentication
Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx) to handle authentication.
Create a .htpasswd file with username admin and password securepassword.
Validate Metrics
Use curl to verify metrics at Prometheus' /metrics endpoint: bash curl -u admin:securepassword http://localhost:9090/metrics

Ans:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nginx apache2-utils

$ sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd admin
password. Enter: securepassword

$ vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name _;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
### Add below section ####
        location /metrics {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:9090/metrics;
                auth_basic "Restricted Prometheus";
                auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
        }
}

$ sudo nginx -t
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
