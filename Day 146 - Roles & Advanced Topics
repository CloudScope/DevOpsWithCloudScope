Q2. Ansible Class 4 Assignment 2

Implement a Role to Add System Users
Objective
Develop an Ansible role named add_user that simplifies the process of adding new system users on Linux servers.

Detailed Description
The add_user role is designed to efficiently add user accounts to Linux systems. It utilizes configurable parameters to streamline the user creation process, making it ideal for setups ranging from new deployments to expanding existing systems.

Key Features
User Creation: Automatically adds new user accounts with configurable usernames and optional settings for home directories and shells.
Configurable User Properties: Allows specification of user details like user_name, user_shell, and whether to create a home directory through role variables.
This setup uses the add_user role to create a user named john_doe with a bash shell and a home directory on all targeted hosts. Adjust the variables as necessary to customize the user account setup.

Q3. Ansible Class 4 Assignment 3

Firewall Configuration with Conditionals
Objective
Create an Ansible role named firewall_setup that manages the configuration of the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) on Ubuntu servers. This role should dynamically allow or deny services based on a specified variable.

Detailed Description
This role aims to provide a flexible firewall management system using UFW. It leverages Ansible's capability to use conditionals, ensuring that firewall rules adapt based on the configuration specified in the playbook or external variables.

Key Features
Conditional Firewall Rules: Based on the boolean value of service_allowed, the role will configure UFW to either allow or deny specific services such as HTTP and SSH.
Dynamic Rule Application: The role will use Ansible's ufw module to apply firewall rules dynamically, allowing for real-time security adjustments based on environment or security requirements.

Ans:


$ sudo apt update -y;sudo apt install tree

$ tree

`-- roles

Q4. Ansible Class 4 Assignment 4

MySQL Database Setup Using Roles and Handlers
Objective
Create the mysql_setup Ansible role to automate MySQL server installation and configuration on Linux systems. This role manages the entire lifecycle of MySQL databases, from installation and user setup to dynamic configuration updates.

Detailed Description
The mysql_setup role simplifies MySQL database management by automating:

Installation: Installs MySQL using system package managers, ensuring the database server is set up correctly.
Configuration Management: Utilizes Ansible handlers to apply and react to configuration changes dynamically, restarting the MySQL service as needed to keep settings updated without manual intervention.
