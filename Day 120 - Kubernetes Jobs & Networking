Q1. Kubernetes Class 4 Assignment 5

Raw Problem

Objective:

Secure Pod communication using Network Policies. Create two Pods named frontend and backend in the default namespace. Use the nginx image for both. Configure a Network Policy to allow only the frontend` Pod to communicate with the backend Pod, while blocking all other traffic.

TASK - 1:

Create the Pods.

TASK - 2:

Create a Network Policy to restrict communication.

TASK - 3:

Verify that the Network Policy is working as expected.

Ans:

vi pods.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: frontend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: backend
  labels:
    app: backend
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

vi network-policy.yaml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: backend-policy
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
