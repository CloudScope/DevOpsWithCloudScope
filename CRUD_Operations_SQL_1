Q3. New Salary

ontext:
Zenith Tech Solutions is a growing software development company. The company is reviewing employee compensation and considering salary increases as a way to reward employee performance and stay competitive in the job market, Zenith Tech is considering a salary increase for all staff. To calculate the potential impact of a salary increase, Zenith Tech wants to analyze the effects of a 20% raise for all employees. By analyzing the "New_salary" column, Zenith Tech can assess the overall financial implications of a company-wide raise and make an informed decision about salary adjustments. This can help them retain valuable talent and attract top performers in the competitive tech industry.
Problem Description:
Write a SQL query to create a new column named "New_salary" within their "employees" table. This column will reflect the adjusted salary after applying a 20% raise to the current salary ("salary").

Steps to calculate the salary increment:
1) Multiply the current salary by the percentage of the increment.
2) Divide the result by 100.
3) Then add the result to the current salary.
4) Name the column as 'New_Salary'
5) Round off the 'New_salary'. Use Round() for this.

Result:
Return the columns emp_id, name, salary, and 'New_salary'.
Order the output by the emp_id in ascending order.

Table: employees

| Field	 | Type	       |
