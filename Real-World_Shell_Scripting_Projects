DevOps Class - 9 Assignment - 1

There is script present in your system server_setup.sh, you need to edit this script in order to these below tasks.
Task 1: Software Installation and System Update
Objective: Update the server with necessary software and update all existing packages.
Update and Upgrade: Start by refreshing the package lists and upgrading all installed packages to enhance both security and functionality.
Software Installation: Install essential software such as Nginx for web serving, Apache2-utils for Apache server management, UFW for firewall configurations, Fail2ban for security against brute-force attacks, and Vim as a versatile text editor.


Task 2: User Setup
Objective: Establish user accounts with predefined configurations to manage access control efficiently.
User Creation: Create specific user accounts like `johndoe` and `janedoe`, setting them up with initial passwords and necessary user details, ensuring they have the correct permissions for their roles.


Task 3: Security Hardening and Logging
Objective: Enhance the security measures to safeguard the server.
There is firewall Configured in your background. You need to do these tasks to ensure security measures:
Disable Unused Services: Disable services that are not in use, such as Apache2 if it's redundant, to reduce potential security vulnerabilities.
Secure SSH Access: Adjust SSH configurations to improve security measures, including disabling root login to prevent direct remote access to the server’s root account.

Ans:

#!/bin/bash


# Update and Install Software Packages
echo "Updating and Installing software packages..."
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y || error_exit "Failed to update and upgrade system."
sudo apt-get install -y nginx apache2 fail2ban vim ufw || error_exit "Failed to install required packages."

# Adding Users
echo "Adding users..."
sudo adduser johndoe --gecos "John Doe, RoomNumber, WorkPhone, HomePhone" --disabled-password
echo "johndoe:password" | sudo chpasswd
sudo adduser janedoe --gecos "Jane Doe, RoomNumber, WorkPhone, HomePhone" --disabled-password
echo "janedoe:password" | sudo chpasswd || error_exit "Failed to add users."

# Disable Unused Services
echo "Disabling unused services..."
sudo systemctl disable --now apache2 || error_exit "Failed to disable Apache2."

# Disable root SSH login
# File path to the SSHD config
SSHD_CONFIG="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"

# Disable root login in SSHD config
if grep -q "^PermitRootLogin" $SSHD_CONFIG; then
   # Modify the existing PermitRootLogin setting
   sudo sed -i 's/^PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' $SSHD_CONFIG
elif grep -q "^#PermitRootLogin" $SSHD_CONFIG; then
   # Uncomment and modify the PermitRootLogin setting if it is commented out
   sudo sed -i 's/^#PermitRootLogin.*/PermitRootLogin no/' $SSHD_CONFIG
else
   # Add PermitRootLogin setting if it doesn't exist
   echo "PermitRootLogin no" | sudo tee -a $SSHD_CONFIG
fi

# Restart the SSH service to apply changes
sudo systemctl restart ssh || error_exit "Failed to restart SSH service."

echo "Server setup completed successfully."

Test 1: HTML Report Generation
Objective: Verify that the system health report in HTML format is successfully generated and stored at the specified location.
Method: The test checks if the file `/var/log/system_health_report.html` exists.


Test 2: Content Verification of HTML Report
Objective: Ensure that the HTML report includes all necessary sections covering different aspects of the system's health.
Method: The test verifies the presence of specific sections in the HTML report by searching for titles like "System Health Report", "Uptime", "CPU and Memory Usage", "Disk Usage", and "Recently Installed Security Patches".



Test 3: Email Delivery Check
Objective: Confirm that the system health report is emailed to the intended recipient, `janedoe`.
Method: The test reads the mailbox file for `janedoe` and checks for the presence of keywords associated with the system health report to ascertain if the email was sent and contains relevant content.

Ans:


#!/bin/bash

LOGFILE="/var/log/system_report.log"

error_exit()
{
echo "$1" 1>&2
exit 1
}

send_email()
{
local subject="Weekly System Health Report"
local body_file="$1"
local recipient_user="janedoe"
echo "Sending the system report via email to $recipient_user…"
mail -s "subject"−a"Content−type:text/html;" $recipient_user@localhost < $body_file
}

HTML_REPORT="/var/log/system_health_report.html"

{
echo "<html><head></head><body>"
echo "<h1>System Health Report - $(date +’%Y-%m-%d’)</h1>"
echo "<h2>Uptime:</h2>"
echo "<p>$(uptime)</p>"
echo "<h2>CPU and Memory Usage:</h2>"
echo "<pre>$(top -bn1 | head -5)</pre>"
echo "<h2>Disk Usage:</h2>"
echo "<pre>$(df -h)</pre>"
echo "<h2>Recently Installed Security Patches:</h2>"
echo "<pre>$(grep -i security /var/log/apt/history.log | tail -10)</pre>"
echo "</body></html>"
} > "$HTML_REPORT" || error_exit "Failed to generate HTML report."

send_email $HTML_REPORT || error_exit "Failed to send email."
echo "System health report generated and sent successfully."

Task: 

Create a script system_maintenance.sh that updates system packages, removes unnecessary files, and cleans up the system.
Objective: Automate regular updates and maintenance tasks on Linux servers to maintain their security and performance.

Requirements:

Package Updates: Update all installed packages using the system’s package manager.
Cleanup Tasks: Clean up old cached packages and unused dependencies. Remove old kernel versions, keeping only the current and one backup kernel.
Logging: Log all performed actions and any issues encountered during the process.
Learning Goals: This assignment focuses on scripting for system maintenance and update procedures.
Deliverable: Submit the system_maintenance.sh script that fulfills the above requirements.

Ans:


#!/bin/bash


sudo apt update -y

log() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1"
}

CURRENT_KERNEL=$(uname -r | sed 's/-generic//')
log "Current running kernel: $CURRENT_KERNEL"

# List installed kernels, exclude current and latest backup
INSTALLED_KERNELS=$(dpkg --list | grep 'linux-image-[0-9]' | awk '{ print $2 }' | grep -v "${CURRENT_KERNEL}")

# Get the latest backup kernel
LATEST_BACKUP=$(dpkg --list | grep 'linux-image-[0-9]' | awk '{ print $2 }' | grep -v "${CURRENT_KERNEL}" | tail -n 1)
log "Latest backup kernel identified: $LATEST_BACKUP"
# Remove old kernels, excluding current and latest backup
for KERNEL in ${INSTALLED_KERNELS}; do
    if [ "$KERNEL" != "$LATEST_BACKUP" ]; then
        log "Attempting to remove $KERNEL"
        if sudo apt-get remove --purge -y $KERNEL; then
           log "Successfully removed $KERNEL"
        else
           log "ERROR: Failed to remove $KERNEL"
        fi
    fi

# Clean up
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge -y
