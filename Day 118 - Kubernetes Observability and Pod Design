Q1. Probes in Kubernetes

Raw Problem

This assignment has three separate tasks involving readiness, liveness, and startup probes for managing different lifecycle aspects of Kubernetes pods. By configuring different probes to manage pod lifecycle events effectively, you can enhance the robustness and reliability of Kubernetes applications.

TASK - 1:
Readiness Probe Configuration

Ensure a web application is ready to serve traffic only when a specific file is present.

Pod Name: web-app
Container Image: nginx:latest
Probe Details: Check for a file /tmp/ready exists in the container created.
Initial delay: 5 seconds, check every 10 seconds.

TASK - 2:
Liveness Probe Configuration

Restart the service if it fails to respond for a specified duration.

Pod Name: api-service
Container Image: busybox
Probe Details: Run a command to check if the /tmp/health exists in the container created.
Check every 10 seconds with a failure threshold of 3.

TASK - 3:
Startup Probe Configuration

Manage the initialization of a slow-starting application.

Pod Name: slow-start-app
Container Image: busybox
Probe Details: Run the command cat /tmp/startup exists in the container created.
The initial delay of 10 seconds, with a period of 5 seconds, allow 2 retries before failure.

Objective:

Create three separate pods, each configured with a specific probe to manage their lifecycle effectively based on the conditions specified in each task.

Ans:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: multi-probe-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web-app
    image: nginx:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
    args:
      - |
        touch /tmp/ready; # Create the readiness file
        nginx -g 'daemon off;'; # Start nginx
    ports:
      - containerPort: 80
    readinessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - "test -f /tmp/ready"
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10

  - name: api-service
    image: busybox
    args:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - "touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 3600"
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
          - sh
          - -c
          - "test -f /tmp/healthy"
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 10
      failureThreshold: 3   

  - name: slow-start-app
    image: busybox
    args:
      - /bin/sh
      - -c
      - "sleep 20; touch /tmp/startup; sleep 3600"
    startupProbe:
      exec:
        command:
          - cat
          - /tmp/startup
      initialDelaySeconds: 25
      periodSeconds: 5
      failureThreshold: 10

Q2. Deployment Strategy in Kubernetes

Raw Problem

**Raw Problem**
Objective

The DevOps team wants to minimize downtime during updates. Implement a Blue Green deployment strategy using Nginx and ConfigMaps. Create two ConfigMaps for the Blue and Green environments with different index.html content. Deploy the Blue environment first and then switch traffic to the Green environment.

TASK - 1:

Create ConfigMaps for Blue and Green environments.

TASK - 2:

Deploy the Blue environment with a ConfigMap containing <h1>Blue</h1>.

TASK - 3:

Expose the Blue deployment.

TASK - 4:

Deploy the Green environment with a ConfigMap containing <h1>Green</h1>.

TASK - 5:

Switch traffic to the Green environment by updating the Service selector.
